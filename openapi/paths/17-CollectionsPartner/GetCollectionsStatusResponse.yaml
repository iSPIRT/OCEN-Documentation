  summary: Trigger Repayment Status Response
  description: This API is used by Collections Partner on the Lender to check the status of a previously initiated repayment transaction. In the case where collection is handled by Collection Management System (CMS), once the Collection Partner receives payment confirmation (including transaction reference number) from the Collection Management System, Collections Partner will send a request to the lender to check if a payment has been credited against the transaction Reference Number.
