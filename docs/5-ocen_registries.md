# OCEN Registry and Product Network

OCEN 4.0 introduces the OCEN registry that will be maintained via SROs. All **products** served on OCEN as well as **participants** that serve a product are registered in the **OCEN registry** as part of the initial onboarding process onto OCEN 4.0. And the product is served by participants as part of a **Product Network**.

# Participant Onboarding

All participants are onboarded to OCEN 4.0 via the participant onboarding in OCEN registry. A standard onboarding process is followed for all participants, and their verification is guaranteed by SROs to ensure that new members receive an equivalent level of trust within the network.
