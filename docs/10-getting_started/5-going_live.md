# 4. Going Live
Upon completion of the earlier four steps the participants will be ready to take their product live and serve the borrowers on OCEN. 

Going live requires:
1. Re-creation of the Product, Product Network in production environment 
2. Participants updating their credentials with production credentials 
3. Participants validating the end-to-end loan journey with a sample loan application 

The OCEN team will assist with the above for the OCEN 4.0 Wave 1 participants.
