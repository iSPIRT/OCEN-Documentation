# OCEN 4.0

The OCEN model has been being built incrementally in phases, with reinforced learnings from each of the previous pilots. 

**OCEN 4.0** is the latest implementation, versioned *4.0* for its API specification. The goal for OCEN 4.0 is to build an ecosystem of participants that creates a cambrian explosion of cash-flow based loan products across different sectors and different types of borrowers. This builds on previous pilots with the following key changes:

1. **Partipant Roles:** OCEN 4.0 adds new specialized participant roles to promote specialization and to enhance system efficiency. For example, by establishing a local network of participants that can help with KYC, Disbursement, Collections and Data for underwriting, the burden on lenders is reduced, resulting in increased credit accessibility in underprivileged areas.

2. **Registries:** OCEN 4.0 introduces two separate registries - **Participant Registry** for Participants and **Product Registry** for Products, that are maintained via SROs. The registries allow for creation and discoverability of new products in the ecosystem that can served by a network of participants. The SRO in this model ensures a strong dispute resolution system via authorized mediation.

3. **Product Networks:** OCEN 4.0 introduces the notion of a Product Network for serving a product. The Product Network enables a group of different participants to come together to serve a particular Product to a set of borrowers via a Loan Agent. LAs will create & manage Product Network while Lenders will create the Products. All participants can browse the Products and Product Network on the Product Registry and collaborate using Product Network. 

4. **OCEN 4.0 APIs:** The previous sepcification is also updated such that the APIs across various products, actions and roles require minimal integration effort. The APIs across all participants are standardized so that a one-time integration can unlock future collaborations with new parties to serve new products.
