# API Design Principles

## Async design

By design, all APIs are designed to enable end-to-end flows asynchronously. All requests use the requestId field for the purposes for mapping responses to their respective requests. And each request generates a standard acknowledgement from the other end while the callee (typically Lender) processes the request. API callers (typically LA) can poll for the status of the operation using a webhook. Thus each operation will have two separate APIs - one from the caller to submit the request and another async response back from the callee when the operation has completed.

For example: Create Loan Application operation has the following 2 APIs:
- CreateLoanApplicationRequest -> Request sent by LA to the Lender
- CreateLoanApplicationResponse -> Async Response sent by Lender to LA


## Idempotency

All request calls should be idempotent on the requestId field i.e. two calls to CreateLoanApplication with the same requestId shouldnâ€™t result in two applications to be created. Callees are expected to return the same response as sent earlier for a duplicate request.
