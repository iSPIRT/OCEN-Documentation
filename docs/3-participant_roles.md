# Participant Roles

OCEN 4.0 supports specialized roles for the participants. The purpose of introducing new roles is that it promote specialization and enhances system efficiency. For example, by establishing a local network of participants, the burden on lenders is reduced, resulting in increased credit accessibility in underprivileged areas.
