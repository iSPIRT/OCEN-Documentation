# Auth Service Overview

The Auth service addresses two main concerns in the ecosystem:
1. Identity of the entity accessing an endpoint
2. Integrity and non-repudiation so entities cannot deny their actions after performing any operation

The Auth service enables both concerns by providing API access keys for authentication of every request as well as signing every request/response with the security certificates.
