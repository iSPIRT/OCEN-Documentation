# Product Registry
Web portal where Lenders in the OCEN ecosystem register their products. Once a product is created, participants such as LAs registered in the Participant registry will be able to view and subscribe to these products. The Product Registry allows LAs and other participants to easily discover new products for their borrowers from different lenders. The Product Registry also enables Lenders to reach new borrowers via the LAs that subscribe to the products.

**TODO:** Add more details on the Product Registry. Add pitcures of the portal and more details.
