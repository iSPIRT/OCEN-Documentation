    # Introduction

    OCEN 4.0: Open Credit Enablement Network specification APIs

    India is starved of access to formal, affordable credit. There is a massive market opportunity to be tapped here that has been inhibited because the current rails for flow of capital to the untapped market are broken.

    They are broken for the lenders, to be able to reach out to these prospective borrowers and surface creditworthy borrowers. Few of the many reasons include high cost of borrower acquisition and time consuming custom third party tie-ups with loan originators.

    They are broken for the marketplaces to connect their customers with lenders. The custom integrations and manual processes are costly and time consuming. The Turnaround Time to get loans deposited to customers is high and their ability to provide custom financial products quickly is restricted, owing to implementation challenges.

    Sourcing, identity verification, underwriting, disbursement, recollections and dispute management are few of the many responsibilities managed by a lender today. Historically, the best lenders have had to excel at each of these skills in order to maximize their profit pools and serve the larger and larger markets.

    OCEN is an initiative to unbundle lending and enable the creation of specialized entities, each specialized at one part of the job. Therefore, we envision the future of lending to be a partnership between multiple firms individually focused on sourcing/distribution, identity verification, underwriting, capital arrangement, recollections, etc. The entities like marketplaces who have high business-connect with their customers (businesses or individuals), can embed credit offerings in their applications now. These entities are referred to as ‘Borrower Agents’ (BAs) and were previously referred to as  'Loan Service Providers' (LSPs).

    BA is a departure from the Direct Sourcing Agent (DSA) model and is an 'agent of the borrower'. BA explains to borrowers their 'bill of rights' ensuring transparency and safeguarding of borrower interests. It educates them about the various credit product offerings, pricing and more details. It helps them get access to formal, affordable credit at low interest rates and collaborates with lenders to create more tailored offerings for borrowers.

    A reference pilot was created to showcase the power of the above idea in the GST SAHAY pilot project that used the OCEN 3.3 APIs. In its simplest form, it's a loan marketplace that enables SMEs to compare loan offers from multiple lenders and choose the best one. In its more advanced version, this BA would be akin to a borrower’s financial advisor, looking after their interests, fetching the best offers and advising the customer to make good decisions.

    In the longer run, it is envisioned that many more BAs (with apps) will be created. Each of these would focus on distinct borrower pools and build the specialized experiences suited to their customers. This would allow lenders to focus purely on their underwriting and collections logic and cater to diverse collaborations with the BAs.

    This is a manifestation of our efforts to democratise credit.

    # Terminology

    Following is the list of all abbreviations used in the document

    | Acronym | Expansion |
    | --- | --- |
    | AA | Account Aggregator |
    | BA | Borrower Agent |
    | LSP | Loan Service Provider (see BA) |
    | OCEN | Open Credit Enablement Network |

    # Changes in Version 4.0

    This is version 4.0 of the OCEN Specification. This is an update to the earlier OCEN APIs Specification v3.3 used by the GST SAHAY pilot.

    OCEN v3.3 API Specification is implemented by the LSP and the Lender entities. The entities directly communicate with each other as there is only one LSP in the architecture.  

    The new OCEN 4.0 version enables multiple participants in the ecosystem across various roles.  Additionally, apart from the API specification, this version also includes 3 new components (Auth service, Product registry and Participant Registry) that enable the coordination between the multiple participants in the system. 

    # Participant Roles 

    OCEN 4.0 supports the following different roles for participants:
    - Lender - Creates and owns the product 
    - Borrower Agent (BA) - Creates a Product Group - the network of participants needed to fulfil all the needs to the product such as collections partner, disbursement partner, etc and serves as the agent of the borrower by surfacing the offers and enabling the loan application process  
    - Derived Data Provider (DDP) - Enables better underwriting for the lender by providing additional data about the borrower or about the market of the product 
    - Disbursement Agent (DA) - Enables disbursement of the loan
    - Collections Agent (CA) - Enables monitoring and collections post disbursement

    # OCEN 4.0 Components

    Apart from the API specification for the participants to communicate with each other, OCEN 4.0 includes 3 components that enable coordination between the different participants in the system - 
    - Auth Service
    - Product registry and 
    - Participant Registry 

    ## Auth Service
    The Auth service addresses two main concerns in the ecosystem:

    1. Identity of the entity accessing an endpoint
    2. Integrity and non-repudiation so entities cannot deny their actions after performing any operation

    The Auth service enables both concerns by providing API access keys for authentication of every request as well as signing every request/response with the security certificates.

    ## Product Registry

    Web portal where Lenders in the OCEN ecosystem register their products. Once a product is created, participants such as BAs registered in the Participant registry will be able to view and subscribe to these products. The Product Registry allows BAs and other participants to easily discover new products for their borrowers from different lenders. The Product Registry also enables Lenders to reach new borrowers via the BAs that subscribe to the products. 

    ## Participant Registry

    Web portal where all the participants in the OCEN ecosystem register themselves. Post approval, participants will be able to fetch access keys to use in making the API calls. 

    # High Level Architecture
    The following is a high-level sequence diagram of the OCEN 4.0 flow for the initial phases from Product creation through loan granting that highlights the role of the above components. The end-to-end flow can be split into 3 phases:
    1. Onboarding
    2. Loan Application and Processing
    3. Post-Disbursement

    # Participant Overview
    Below are the technical requirements and the end-to-end flow from the perspective of each participant in the ecosystem.

    ## Lender Overview
    Below is the overview of the end-to-end flow from the perspective of a Lender.

    ### Onboarding Phase
    Lenders first need to be onboarded onto the Participant Registry with their basic data. Once approved, they can use the API access key from the Participant Registry portal for making the API calls.

    Lenders will then create the product in the Product Registry portal with all necessary attributes such as:
    - Product category
    - Borrower types
    - Data requirements
    - Loan workflow configurations - Collections, Disbursement, etc.
     
    Once a product has been created and added to the portal, all participants will be able to discover the product. Participants can then subscribe to any of the existing products that need their role as part of the product’s loan workflow.

    The Lender will serve as the OWNER of the product and is the only participant who can change the product attributes subsequently.

    Post product-creation, Lenders get added to Product Groups by Borrower Agents to serve borrowers in their network. They then start receiving Loan Application requests.

    *There are no API calls and implementation in this phase.*

    ### Loan Application and Processing Phase
    Lenders receive Loan Application requests from the Borrower Agent, request Consent from the borrower and initiate the loan Offer. Upon acceptance of the Offer, the Lender performs the borrower KYC, confirms the loan disbursement and repayment terms with the borrower and then grants the loan. 

    The handshake and the steps in this phase follow the APIs defined in the APIs list. 

    ### Post-Disbursement Phase
    Post-disbursement of the loan, any disputes from the borrower are handled by the Lender via the Loan Dispute APIs in the APIs list.

    ### Metadata APIs
    In addition to the above, the Lender will maintain a Heartbeat API (see APIs list) to indicate the health status of their systems to the rest of the network.

    ## BA Overview
    Below is the overview of the end-to-end flow from the perspective of a Borrower Agent participant across the 3 phases of the OCEN 4.0 flow.

    ### Onboarding Phase
    BAs first need to be onboarded onto the Participant Registry with their basic data. Once approved, they can use the API access key from the Participant Registry portal for making the API calls.

    Borrower Agents in the ecosystem will then be able to drive the product life cycle by inviting other necessary participants needed in the product’s loan workflow. Once registered in the portal, BAs can create a Product Group and invite other participants (Collections, Disbursement partners and Derived Data Providers) for a particular product.

    BAs also need to select an SRO who will manage any dispute resolution issues for them and will serve as the guardrails against bad actors in the ecosystem.

    There are no API calls and implementation in this phase.

    ### Loan Application and Processing Phase
    BAs forward the Loan Application requests to the Lender. They then drive the Loan Application process with the lender by enabling the Lender to get Consent from the borrower and then to provide the loan Offer. Upon acceptance of the Offer by the borrower, the BA enables the Lender to perform the borrower KYC, confirm the loan disbursement and repayment terms with the borrower and then to grant the loan. 

    The handshake and the steps in this phase follow the APIs defined in the APIs list. 

    ### Post-Disbursement Phase
    Post-disbursement of the loan, any disputes from the borrower are forwarded to the Lender by the BA via the Loan Dispute APIs (see APIs list).

    ### Metadata APIs
    In addition to the above, the BA will maintain a Heartbeat API (see APIs list) to indicate the health status of their systems to the rest of the network.

    # API Design Principles

    ## Async design
    By design, all APIs are designed to enable end-to-end flows asynchronously. All requests use the requestId field for the purposes for mapping responses to their respective requests. And each request generates a standard acknowledgement from the other end while the callee (typically Lender) processes the request. API callers (typically BA) can poll for the status of the operation using a webhook. Thus each operation will have two separate APIs - one from the caller to submit the request and another async response back from the callee when the operation has completed. 

    For example: Create Loan Application operation has the following 2 APIs:
    - CreateLoanApplicationRequest -> Request sent by BA to the Lender
    - CreateLoanApplicationResponse -> Async Response sent by Lender to BA

    ## Idempotency
    All request calls should be idempotent on the requestId field i.e. two calls to CreateLoanApplication with the same requestId shouldn’t result in two applications to be created. Callees are expected to return the same response as sent earlier for a duplicate request.

    ## Complete Request Objects 
    All API calls and interactions are designed to include complete request objects instead of just the object identifiers in the request / responses. This design is to enable caller and callee to be able to process the request without needing to look up the attributes and other details.

    ## Security

    > To be updated

    All participants must follow the security requirements while transmitting data over API calls. On a high level, these are the security aspects that need to be ensured.

    1. HTTPS - All API calls must be done securely over HTTPS
    2. Two-way TLS -  The system should use Two-way TLS to ensure that both parties can send the information securely
    3. Digital Signature - All communication between the participants should be digitally signed as per the JSON Web Signature Specification
    4. Post participant registration with the Participant Registry, the private / public keys for authentication will be available in the portal

    ### What is two-way TLS/SSL
    The credit system that we are building is an asynchronous system and we need to ensure that both systems follow Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol to communicate with each other. In Normal TLS, the client first checks the authenticity of the server. However, the server does not try to identify the client. Since, in our case, we need to verify the identities of both the systems involved, “Two Way SSL” needs to be used. "Two-Way SSL" is usually called TLS/SSL with client certificate authentication because both parties authenticate each other.
